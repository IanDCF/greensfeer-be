## Getting Started

To set up and run the Greensfeer Server locally, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (Version 16 or higher)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli) (for Firebase-related commands)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/IanDCF/greensfeer-be.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd greensfeer-be
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Configuration

- Set up your Firebase project and obtain the necessary configuration keys.
- Configure your Firebase project by creating a keys.json file following the keys.example.json file format.

### Server Hosting

The Greensfeer Server is hosted using [Firebase Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions). Firebase Functions is a serverless compute service that allows you to run backend code in response to HTTP requests or other events. This approach provides scalability, reliability, and easy deployment for the server component of Greensfeer.

### Local Development

During local development, you can use the Firebase Emulator Suite to test your functions locally before deploying them to the cloud. To start the emulator suite, use the following command:

```bash
npm run serve
```

## Deployment

You can deploy the Greensfeer Server to your preferred hosting platform or use Firebase Hosting and Cloud Functions for deployment. Ensure that you have the Firebase CLI configured for deployment.

To deploy to Firebase, use the following command:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

## Usage

The Greensfeer Server provides a set of APIs and services that are utilized by the Greensfeer front-end UI.
